# Netflix_Business_Case_Study
In this business case study, we delve into how Netflix harnesses the power of data to drive strategic decision-making and enhance user experience. Netflix, a global leader in streaming entertainment, operates in a highly competitive landscape where understanding audience preferences is paramount.
I developed a Python project aimed at delving into a Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective was to execute thorough data cleaning procedures and delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights from the extensive Netflix content catalog.

Project Workflow:

Data Cleaning:
1. Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Utilized the `info()` method to comprehend the dataset's structure.
3. Detected and handled missing values appropriately, either through replacement or removal.
4. Addressed duplicates within the dataset.
5. Segregated values and retained the first segment before the comma for enhanced clarity.
6. Splitted multiple values in a row to a single row.
7. Carried out Imputation wherever required.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Explored the distribution of content types, distinguishing between movies and TV shows.
2. Analyzed the geographical distribution of content across different countries.
3. Investigated the temporal distribution of content releases, identifying potential trends over time.
4. Examined the distribution of ratings to glean insights into audience preferences.
5. Explored the relationship between content duration and type to discern any patterns.
6. Conducted an analysis to identify the top five favored genres.
7. Investigated the top 10 movies or TV shows based on duration, providing insights into viewer preferences.
8. Explored the prominence of actors by quantifying their appearances across movies and TV shows.

Visualization:
1. Leveraged libraries such as Matplotlib to craft compelling visualizations for key insights.
2. Created a bar chart illustrating the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows).
3. Plotted a time series depicting the addition of content over the years to discern growth patterns.
4. Developed a pie chart to showcase the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows).
5. Constructed a horizontal bar chart highlighting the top 10 countries based on the number of titles they produced.

Through meticulous data cleaning and insightful exploratory analysis, the project aimed to provide comprehensive insights into the vast array of content available on Netflix, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
